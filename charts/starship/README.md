# Starship

Starship's helm charts

Dependent external charts

* `timescaledb-single` Single node deployment of timescaleDB.
* `promscale` Timescale's prom & OTel connector, to enable ingesting and querying Prom & OTel data with the corresponding 
  ingestion, transport, and query protocols.
* `kube-prometheus-stack` Prom collector, which defines how Prom collector connects to PromScale. This defines Prom collector.
  Application prometheus service monitor and pod monitor, this requires installing [Prom operator](
  https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#installing-the-operator).

## Templates

### Agent

* `daemonset.yaml` Defines agent daemonset, which runs on each and every Kubernetes node. They run eBPF+WASM data collection modules.
  And collect Kubernetes process and container information, and writes to API Server for serialization.

TODO: Consider include [PGBouncer](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer) to have connection pool to support large kubernetes cluster.
Because agents right now connects to PG directly for writing data collected by the eBPF+WASM data collection modules.

### API Server with UI

* `service.yaml` Defines the service for connecting to the API server's backend server, and the management UI (backed by Nginx reverse proxy)
* `serviceaccount.yaml` Defines service accounts for API Sever's metadata service sub-component to access Kubernetes API server's updates of
  Kubernetes objects.
* `statefulset.yaml` Defines pods for API Server and management Web UI (nginx reverse proxy)

### Kubenetes Prometheus Stack

This directory includes the configurations of databases for storing prom, otel, generic time-series data.

TODO: Rename to datasource or something relevant

* `connection-secret-job.yaml` Store credentials into K8s secret, for PromScale to connect to TimescaleDB.
* `grafana-dashboards-conf.yaml` Stores configurations of the pre-built dashboards.
* `grafana-datasources-sec.yaml` Stores configurations of prom, otel, and timescale time-series database query endpoints and credentials.
